To run the GNU test suit provided by Makefile::Parser,
the following steps should be followed:

  * Set the MAKE_PATH environment to the gnu make 
    utility you want to test. If MAKE_PATH is not 
    set, then 'make' will be used.
  * Ensure the current directory is the foler where
    this README file is in.
  * Enter the following command to start the tester:
      prove -I../.. -r
