======

To run the GNU test suit provided by Makefile::Parser,
the following steps should be followed:

  * Set the GNU_MAKE_PATH environment to the gnu make 
    utility you want to test. If GNU_MAKE_PATH is not 
    set, then 'make' will be used.
  * Ensure the current directory is the foler where
    this README file is in.
  * Enter the following command to start the tester:
      prove -I../.. -r

By default, this GNU `make' test suit will run on a `sh'
simulator witten in pure perl, say, the script
`../../script/sh'. To use a differen shell, set the
GNU_SHELL_PATH to the path of that shell. For instance,

   GNU_SHELL_PATH = /bin/sh

will use the local `sh' to speed up the testing process.
However, using local `sh' may cause part of the test suit
to fail.
