TASKS
=====

- t/sh/: add wildcard.t, rm.t, sleep.t, cd.t, pwd.t, and ls.t
- implement `ls' builtin command for script/sh
- develop tb-index.pl which can index "TEST 0:", "TEST 1:", etc.,
  automatically for tests based on Test::Base
- migrate the test suit to the up-to-date GNU make 3.81 beta4
- port the remaining tests for t/gnu/features/
- abstract out another project for a unified script/command testing
  framework based on IPC::Run3 and Test::Base. I think I should call
  it Test::Cmd::Base (Testing scripts/commands enjoying Test::Base's
  power)
