- factor out `split_arg' and `process_escape' 
  from t::Util into t::Util::Tiny, so as to reduce
  the startup time of script/sh
- re-add "TEST 0", "TEST 1", etc. back into
  t/gnu/features/*.t to facilitate the debugging
  process
- factor out `process_out' from t::Backend::Base
  into t::Util, which will also supports `---stdout_like',
  `---stderr_like', and `---success' block sections
